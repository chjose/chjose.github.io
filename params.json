I like studying about machine learning, data mining and recommendation systems. This semester i will be working for a startup as a programmer under three prominent Professors from Rutgers and NYU.\r\n\r\n### Areas of Interest\r\nI am passionate about coding. Currently i am attending interviews to get into a company where i could use my skills and develop new. My favorite language is C, Java and Python in the order of interest. I develop cool android apps to help my friends to travel, to explore. The app which i am currently developing is about soft routing. Other areas which i am interested are improvement of the algorithm of common mapping/routing applications so that they could give the best route to a search. Presently it is observed that all the common applications give different route and ETA for the same start and destination.\r\n\r\n### Current Capacity\r\nCurrently I am working as in a Team Lead capacity on an Urban Routing application under the direction of Professor Martin Farach-Colton and Professor Muthu Muthukrishnan. Technologies used are Android, Map Quest open source code, Google Maps API and Python script for scrapping the data. This is a startup venture designed to facilitate pedestrian city navigation and allow the user to take advantage of various highlights that the city has to offer.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Professor Periklis Papakonstantinou\r\n\r\nemail: periklis.papakonstantinou@rutgers.edu \r\n\r\n\r\n* Professor Vivek Singh\r\n\r\nemail: vivek.k.singh@rutgers.edu \r\n\r\n### Contact details and Resume\r\nEmail me: christin.jose@rutgers.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinjose)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Github](https://www.github.com/chjose)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vr8fjq2gtgfgl5/Resume_rutgers.PDF?dl=0)\r\n","google":"UA-75019311-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
